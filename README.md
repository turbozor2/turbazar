Every year, on November 5th in England, they celebrate Guy Fawkes Night. Another name for this celebration is Bonfire Night or Fireworks Night. This holiday originated
from political events in 1605. At that time England was ruled by King Jacob the First. The king was at odds with the Catholic Church. The king imposed heavy fines on religious figures and restricted them in every way possible.
Catholics long demanded that the fines and restrictions be lifted, but the king was adamant. Then a chap called Guy Fawkes put together
a group of men and planned to murder King James the First on 5 November 1605. But someone on Guy Fawkes' side told outsiders about the plans and news of the assassination plot reached the king.
The king ordered that Guy Fawkes be found and put in prison. In prison, he was tortured for a long time, after which he told all h
is plans and gave up his associates. In the end, all his supporters were publicly executed. Guy Fawkes himself was quartered. That night, the people of the country held a great feast, 
ighting fires in the streets in honor of their king. 
Since then, the night of Guy Fawkes has been celebrated annually.
Nowadays, the holiday is celebrated in England in a family circle. The traditional symbol of the holiday is the effigy of Guy Fawkes, which is set on fire on the night of the holiday. 
Mashed potatoes and grilled sausages are served on the table that evening. In some homes, the potatoes are baked over charcoal and eaten with a pinch of salt. Another must-try dish is barbecued chicken legs. 
It is served with coleslaw and vegetable salad. For dessert, a baked apple and fruit syrup are served. Few peoknow the origins of this feast, but the English are strict about their traditions.
